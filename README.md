Turtle is a Python library which used to create graphics, pictures, and games. It was developed by Wally Feurzeig, Seymour Parpet and Cynthina Slolomon in 1967. It was a part of the original Logo programming language.Turtle is a Python feature like a drawing board, which lets us command a turtle to draw all over it! We can use functions like turtle.forward(…) and turtle.right(…) which can move the turtle around.
